Web app that access a Rick and Morty api and shows the information from that through buttons accessed in the menu. Menu opens up to 
three sections: characters, locations, and episodes. When one of those are clicked it shows a list of each of the according things
and when you click on a specific item within that section it will give more information about it which is accessed through the api. 
There is a header saying Rick and Morty along with a photo from the show at the top of the page. At the bottom before any section is 
accessed it says no data loaded and that disappears once a section has been opened.
